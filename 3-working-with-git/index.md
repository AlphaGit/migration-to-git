title: Working with Git
---

It is a general information page, but we are using GitHub so we will deepen
into GitHub specific tips.

Since there are a lot of Git clients we need a shared language, for that reason
we will use [Git commands] to explain some common actions.

### Installation

Installing Git is easy. In Linux, all repositories of all distributions have the 
related packages available and updated. For Mac and Windows, you can download it 
from [official Git download page] but we recommend to install your favourite 
[graphic client](git-clients.html) because they also include the command line 
tool.

**Warning**: Do not use PuTTY if you are given the option. GitHub only provides 
support for openssh.

### Create a local repository

### Commit changes

### Push changes to a remote repository

### Cloning a remote repository locally

We will create a local repository in the folder `c:\projects\migration-to-git` 
cloning `https://github.com/MakingSense/migration-to-git`

    cd c:\projects 
	git clone https://github.com/MakingSense/migration-to-git.git
	cd migration-to-git

GitHub recommends accessing to repositories by HTTPS URL, SSH URL is also 
available if you prefer. See [this GitHub help page][remote-url-help] if you 
have troubles with authentication.
