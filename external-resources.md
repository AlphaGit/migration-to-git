### Concepts

* [Capacitación en Git (Spanish)](http://prezi.com/hzbsgv84xl9u/capacitacion-en-git/)
    * Introduction, basic concepts, practical examples
* [Git Magic](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/index.html)
    * Step by step explanations of every operation and why they are useful in real-life scenarios
* [Understanding Git Conceptually](http://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git/)
    * Introduction to concepts (commits, pointers, branches, graphs)
* [Git from the bottom up](http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/git.from.bottom.up.pdf)
    * Detailed explanation of git concepts

### Flows

* [A successful git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
    * Schematic with master + develop + feature branches / hotfixes branches, when finished each is merged onto the others with merge no-ff (master, develop are the ones that get pushed)
* [GitHub-flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)
    * Branches per feature + master, pull requests & merge after code review
* [Developer’s workflow (copy for MakingSense)](https://docs.google.com/a/getcs.com/document/d/1F4oj9MlqJQfwNmBL0pVOY5tk2u6Rl9moUfg0YsyCQ08/edit?usp=sharing)
    * Description of the process: JIRA (project management) + GitHub workflow, some tips

### Practical examples

* [TryGit](http://try.github.io/)
    * Maybe this could be used as an example while we're talking about each command?
    * Disadvantage: we'd have to do it in the same order the site displays them
* [Using GitHub with a project](http://intranet.makingsense.com/display/DTRU/Using+GitHub+with+a+sample+project)
* [Resources / how to guides](http://stackoverflow.com/q/315911/147507)
    * For future reference
