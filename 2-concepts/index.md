#### Staging area aka Index

Is the place where you prepare your changes to _commit_, a _middle_ between your working copy and the repository. You could add or remove files from the stage. Once you build your potential _next commit_ you usually want to review it using `git status` or `git diff`. Only then, you can _commit_ your changes with the command `git commit`.

#### Clone

Is a copy of a repository on your computer, always connected to the remote version in order to get the changes synced.

#### Fork

Is a copy of another user's repository that lives on a server but associated to your account. You can submit pull requests with your changes from your fork or even pull the updates from the original.
