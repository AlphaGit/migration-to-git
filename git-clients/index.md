### Git clients

There are a lot of available clients for git, some of these expose the internal git design and 
architecture to the user, others hide the real git power simplifying it for non-technical 
users. 

In general, at least for programmers, it is a good think to know how git works, because in will
allow us to take advantage of it. For that reason, most of the git clients including a short-cut 
to git command line tool.

#### Git command line tool

The original git user interface is the command line tool. Since many of us are accustomed to using 
Visual Studio, it may intimidate, but, come on! we are programmers! It is a shame if we do not assume 
the challenge. What is more, Microsoft itself is taking that way with _C# compiler (csc)_, _Windows 
Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface_, _TypeScript Compiler (tsc)_ and _PowerShell_.

It is possible to use git command line tool with `cmd.exe` (discouraged) and also with _bash_ in Linux, 
Mac and also in Windows or you can use it with _PowerShell_. It is a nice PowerShell extension named 
Posh-Git.
