### DCA Flow 

<!-- I am not sure to include the complete Project and Client name here -->

In this project we have time boxed sprints and previously defined release dates. 
Also, QA team is not so integrated in deployment process, there is not a large 
unit test coverage and neither a large automated test coverage yet. So, right 
now, in order to ensure quality we need a relatively large time of manual test 
over a stable environment. 

Because all of this things, we have chosen a flow based on git-flow that I will 
describe below.
